# Signal Analyzer
Software for analyzing [digital radio signals].

Contains classes and methods for analyzing WAV recordings of digital radio signals, specifically those which use [FSK encoding]. Also includes classes and methods for generating digital radio signals.

Includes both a GUI and Command-Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with the core library.

Eventual goals include automatic determination of FSK mark and space frequencies and [baud rate] and then using this information to extract the binary data contained in a signal sample.

Uses [Naudio library] to read in a WAV file, [Math.NET Numerics library] to perform FFTs to get its frequency components, and [accord-net library] for its [k-means clustering] implementation.

Get started with your own digital radio signal analysis using this software and a [Software Defined Radio (SDR)].
