# Signal Analyzer
Started developing this for analyzing signals heard while listening to a [Software Defined Radio (SDR)]. Right now there is just one method to read in a WAV file and return the predominant frequency components encountered within it, which should be useful for analyzing [FSK-encoded signals]. Uses [Naudio library] to read in the WAV file and [Math.NET library] to perform an FFT to get the frequency components.
