# Signal Analyzer
Software for analyzing [digital radio signals].

Contains classes and methods for analyzing WAV recordings of digital radio signals, particularly those which use [FSK encoding].

Uses [Naudio library] to read in a WAV file, [Math.NET Numerics library] to perform FFTs to get its frequency components, and [accord-net library] for its [k-means clustering] implementation.

Get started with your own digital radio signal analysis using this software and a [Software Defined Radio (SDR)].
